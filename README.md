### Introduction
PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.

Around 510,000 students in [65 economies](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.oecd.org/pisa/aboutpisa/pisa-2012-participants.htm&sa=D&ust=1560360684115000) took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.

- The data and topics of investigation come from the [PISA Data Visualization Competition](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/datavisualizationcontest.htm&sa=D&ust=1560360684116000).
